    <h1>Software Requirement Specifications</h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The AI Instructional Effectiveness Project aims to analyze transcripts of instructional sessions and provide recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the instruction. The project will use natural language processing techniques to identify questions and analyze the effectiveness of the responses given by the instructor. Based on this analysis, the system will provide recommendations for improving the instructional effectiveness.</p>

    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The system shall be able to accept transcripts in text format.</li>
        <li>The system shall be able to identify questions in the transcript.</li>
        <li>The system shall be able to analyze the effectiveness of the responses given by the instructor.</li>
        <li>The system shall be able to provide recommendations for improving the instructional effectiveness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The system shall have a response time of no more than 5 seconds.</li>
        <li>The system shall be able to handle transcripts of up to 10,000 words.</li>
        <li>The system shall be able to handle multiple users simultaneously.</li>
        <li>The system shall be able to maintain the confidentiality of the transcripts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The system shall be developed using Python programming language.</li>
        <li>The system shall use natural language processing techniques for identifying questions and analyzing responses.</li>
        <li>The system shall be deployed on a cloud-based platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The transcripts will be in English language only.</li>
        <li>The transcripts will be in text format.</li>
        <li>The transcripts will be provided by the user.</li>
    </ul>
